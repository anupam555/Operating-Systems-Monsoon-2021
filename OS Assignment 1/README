								OS Assignment 1
Ques1. 

There are two files, one is fork.c and other is threads.c

i) In the first file, I have used the fork() to create 2 processes, namely Child and parent process, which are used to print the averages of the sections A and B.
fork() creates a duplicate process, which returns an Integer value, depending on the process to be performed. 
If process returns 0, it goes into the Child process 
whereas if greater than 0, it returns to the Parent process.

To compile, first open the terminal and execute the command gcc fork.c -o fork
Then simply type ./fork, it will run the file.

ii) In the second part, we are supposed to calculate the averages using create and join threads.

To compile, first open the terminal and execute the command gcc -o threads.c threads -lpthread
Then simply type ./threads, it will run the file.

In the code, i have created 2 threads, one for calculating average marks of each section in various assignments.
In the main(), after creating and joining the 2 threads, we are supposed to calculate the combined average marks in each of the section.
The averages can be calculated by the arrays storing the average of each assignment.
